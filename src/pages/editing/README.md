### 🔐 Admin Panel

The admin panel is located at `/editing/admin` and is protected by a password.

**How to Access:**
1. Navigate to `https://andrew53o.github.io/editing/admin` (or `http://localhost:4321/editing/admin` during development)
2. Enter the password: `admin123` (default)
3. Click "Login" (or "登入" in Chinese)

**Default Password:** `admin123` (Change this in production!)

**⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:** This admin panel uses client-side authentication for demonstration purposes only. The password is visible in the compiled JavaScript bundle. This is suitable for personal use to prevent casual access, but NOT for protecting sensitive data. For production use with sensitive data, implement proper server-side authentication.

To change the password:
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add: `PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password`
3. Rebuild the site

**Note:** Since this is a static site, true server-side authentication is not possible without additional backend infrastructure. Consider using:
- GitHub OAuth for authentication
- A serverless function (Netlify Functions, Vercel Functions) for authentication
- A headless CMS with built-in authentication

### 📝 Managing Content

#### Adding/Editing Portfolio Videos

Portfolio videos are stored as YAML files in `src/content/videos/`. To add a new video:

1. Create a new `.yml` file in `src/content/videos/`
2. Use this format:

```yaml
id: "unique-id"
title: "Video Title"
description: "Video description"
videoUrl: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
tags:
  - Tag1
  - Tag2
  - Language
```

#### Editing Experience Content

Experience content is defined in `src/pages/editing/experience.astro`. Edit the data arrays directly in the file.

## 🎨 Styling

The editing portfolio uses:
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Dark mode** support (synced with main site)
- **Responsive design** for mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)

Translations are managed in `src/i18n/translations.ts`. To add or modify translations:

1. Open `src/i18n/translations.ts`
2. Add your translation keys to both `en` and `zh` objects
3. Use the `data-i18n` attribute in components to apply translations

Example:
```html
<h1 data-i18n="editing.hero.title">Video Editing Services</h1>
```

## 🔗 Navigation

The editing section has its own navigation component (`EditingNavigation.astro`) separate from the main site. This ensures:
- Clean separation between software engineering and editing portfolios
- Independent navigation structure
- No cross-linking in navigation bars

Access to the editing site is through the "Other Interests" section on the main page.
